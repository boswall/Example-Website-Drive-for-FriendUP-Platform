#Example Website Drive for FriendUP Platform#

A really quick implementation of a Website Drive for the [FriendUP](https://friendup.cloud/) Platform taken from the Developer’s Manual Volume 1 “Draft”, Rev. 2.

This is a simple PHP program for testing what could be done with the Website Drive connector. Please feel free to use it for your own testing.

Get this running on a publically viewable server ( Apache / NGINX ) and create a new connection from your FriendUP Disk Catalog.
